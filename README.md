# Hi! I'm Denis! ðŸ’« ![](https://www.codewars.com/users/denns2002/badges/micro)

ðŸ’¬ I love and study programming. I study both web development and other areas of interest to me. 
For the most part the projects here are educational, but someday something worthwhile will come along.

I like **Python** programming (Backend and other), sometimes I like to do **JS** buttons, layout in **HTML**, **Sass**, and sometimes I get to do projects in **C#**. From time to time I solve tasks related to **SQL**. ðŸ‘¾
Â 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning everything I need for this or that project, a programmer is an eternal student!
